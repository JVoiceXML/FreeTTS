Duke Edinburgh XVIII of U.S. lives on St. Andrew's St., not Dr Edward's Dr.
He is close to Mr. & Mrs. Smithsonian, who live on 4 Napolean Dr..
His phone number is 617-888-6666, which is a Boston, MA phone number.
His mansion was built 3/4 of a century ago, in the 20s, I think between 1915-1918.
It was worth US$7,500,000 5 years ago, and probably about $11 million these days.
Each morning he wakes up at 7:30am to scroll around for about 30 minutes.
If you try to catch him that time, there is a .9999 or 99.99% chance that he is not at home.
