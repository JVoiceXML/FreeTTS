    <pre>

This demo implements a JSAPI text-to-speech server that 
can be used with Emacspeak.

To use this Emacspeak TTS Server:

1. Type "gmake run" in this directory. This runs the TTS Server
   at port 2222. To change the port, modify the System property
   in the Makefile. The following should appear:

<b>
Creating Unlimited domain FreeTTS Speech Synthesizer from Sun Labs...
Loading Unlimited domain FreeTTS Speech Synthesizer from Sun Labs...
...Ready
Waiting on ServerSocket[addr=0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0,port=0,localport=2222]
</b>


2. In your emacspeak (i.e., emacs with emacspeak running), type
   M-x emacspeak-remote-connect-to-server

3. When you are prompted with "<b>Remote host:</b>", specify the
   machine the Emacspeak TTS Server is running. The port is 2222
   by default. Emacspeaks should connect to the TTS Server.

4. At this point, you should hear "<b>Connecting to server on host...</b>"
   at your emacspeak client. You should see the following on 
   the server-side:

<b>

...Ready
Waiting on ServerSocket[addr=0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0,port=0,localport=2222]
