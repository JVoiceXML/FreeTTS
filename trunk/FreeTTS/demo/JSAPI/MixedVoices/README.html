    <pre>

The MixedVoice demo demonstrates how to use multiple voices
and synthesizers in JSAPI. It also demonstrates how to
change various synthesizer properties in JSAPI.


To run this MixedVoices demo on a Unix system, type:

gmake run

To run this demo on a win32 system, type:

$ run MixedVoices


To see how the synthesizer properties change, type:

gmake runVerbose


To see the properties change and events, type:

gmake runVeryVerbose


You should see the following output and hear two people speaking
playfully:

<b>
 ** Mixed Voices - JSAPI Demonstration program **
  Allocating synthesizers...Loading voices...And here we go!
</b>
