The Java Speech API defines a software interface that allows
developers to take advantage of speech technology for
personal and enterprise computing.  By leveraging the inherent 
strengths of the Java platform, the Java Speech API brings
unparalleled portability to developers of speech-enabled applications.

The Java Speech API supports both speech recognition and 
speech synthesis.  Speech recognition software enables computers
to "listen" to incoming speech from a user and determine what
is said.  Speech synthesis, also known as "text to speech",
provides the reverse process of generating speech from text.

Developers who use speech technology through the Java Speech API
can enhance existing user interfaces and can create new means
of human/computer interaction.  Application areas include
telephony systems, dictation and proof-reading, hands-free
environments such as surgery or airline/vehicle maintenance,
accessibility for people with disabilities, and enhanced 
internet browsing.
