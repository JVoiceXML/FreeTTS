Non-important changes
---------------------
12/18/01 - Sometimes one just needs to make a change for change sake. For
instance, I am adding this text so that I can see if the CVS email
notification is working.  If you want to make a change for change
sake, you can edit this file too.

12/18/01 - Well, here is yet another change. CVS has not informed me
of my last change yet. When I sent an email by hand to the mailing
list, I received it, which makes me think that something is not
working write at the CVS syncmail level.  Lets try it again.


12/18/01 - I am still not receiving updates, this time I've set the
CVSROOT/config/PreservePermissions flag to yes.

12/18/01 - The problem was that my mail filter was sending all the
notifications to junk. I've readjusted that. Hopefully things will
work now.
