How to setup MBROLA with FreeTTS
================================

MBROLA comes under many platforms in the form of a standalone binary.
A large number of diphone voice databases exist for many languages.
Three US English voices exist, named us1 (female), us2 (male) and
us3 (male). Binaries and dbs can be downloaded free for non-commercial,
non-military use at:

	http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html

The MBROLA databases are based on the SAMPA phonetic alphabet, but a 
translation table from the phonetic alphabet which Festival (and 
therefore FreeTTS) uses is provided with voice us1 (it is called "us1mrpa").


How to set up the MBROLA files
------------------------------

Decide for a base directory where to put both mbrola binary and mbrola 
voice databases. Let's assume this is /home/jim/mbr. The mbrola binary 
for the correct platform must be downloaded from

	http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html

and placed into that directory (i.e., it is /home/jim/mbr/mbrola).
All voice databases (but at least us1) must be downloaded and
unpacked in the mbrola base directory:

cd /home/jim/mbr
unzip us1-980512.zip 

such that the actual database is the binary file /home/jim/mbr/us1/us1).
For all three voices, the translation table is assumed to be located in 
/home/jim/mbr/us1/us1mrpa. This translation table only ships with us1, 
not with us2 or us3. Therefore, only downloading us2 will produce an 
error.


*IMPORTANT*:
-----------

To use MBROLA with FreeTTS, you must specify your MBROLA directory
as the Java system property "mbrola.base". Java system properties 
are usually specified at the command line with he "-D" switch, e.g.,

java -Dmbrola.base=/home/jim/mbr

For all the FreeTTS demos, you should set the environment variable
MBROLA_DIR (e.g., "setenv MBROLA_DIR /home/jim/mbr" in csh).
This will automatically set the Java system property "mbrola.base".
