# The file_pos test has been removed. A refactoring
# of the tokenization process now causes freetts to
# give file_pos values that are relative to the FreeTTSSpeakable
# not just to the utterance. This is much preferred as compared to
# the previous file_pos within an utterance. So even thought the
# output of freetts does not match flite with regard to the file_pos
# we like our answer better.
