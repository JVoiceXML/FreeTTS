        <p>As of FreeTTS 1.2, FreeTTS provides support to import
        voice data directly from FestVox.  This page describes the
        overall process for doing the import.</p>

        <h3>Creating a Voice</h3>
        <p>You must first create a voice using 
        <a href="http://festvox.org">FestVox</a>.  We've had success
        using FestVox 2.0 on both Linux (RedHat 9.0) and Solaris (use
        gcc 3.2.2 to compile FestVox and Festival on Solaris).
        <b>NOTE that we did not create FestVox, nor can we provide
        support for it.</b>  The creators of FestVox, however, did a
        great job and you can refer to their documentation for where 
        to send any questions or comments.</p>

        <p>FestVox currently provides support for creating two types
        of voices:  diphone and unit selection.  The diphone voices
        support general domain synthesis (i.e., they try to speak any
        text you throw at them).  They are time consuming to create,
        and are usually not a good first choice when learning how to
        create voices.  The unit selection, or limited domain, voices
        only support a limited somain (e.g., telling the time), and
        generally sound very good.</p>

        <p>If you want to experiment with voice creation and
        conversion, we recommend you start with creating a time
        telling voice.</p>

        <p>Please refer to the <a href="http://festvox.org/bsv/">
	FestVox Documentation</a> for information on creating a voice.
        <a href="http://www.festvox.org/bsv/bsv-usukdiphone-ch.html">
        Section IV.19</a> of the FestVox documentation provides a 
        good tutorial on making a US Diphone voice, and 
        <a href="http://www.festvox.org/bsv/x1003.html">
        Section II.5.6</a> provides a good tutorial on recording a
        cluster unit voice for the limited domain of telling
        the time.  <a href="http://www.festvox.org/bsv/bsv-ldom-ch.html">
        Section II.5</a> provides a good general explanation of
        creating a limited domain voice in general.</p>

        <h3>Importing a FestVox Voice into FreeTTS</h3>
        <p>FreeTTS follows many of the same steps that 
        <a href="http://cmuflite.org">Flite</a> follows for importing 
        voices.  For a more detailed description of the process,
        please read
        <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/doc/flite_8.html#SEC14">
        Section 8</a> of the
        <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/doc/index.html">
        Flite documentation</a>.

        <p>To import a voice into FreeTTS, you first need to do the
        following things:
        <ol>
            <li>Compile <a href="http://festvox.org">Festival 1.4.3 and
            FestVox 2.0</a> as well as the speech tools that come with
            Festival.  Refer to the Festival documentation for details
            of setting this up on your system.  We've only built
            Festival and FestVox on RedHat 9.0 and Solaris.  For both
            systems, we used gcc 3.2.2.

            <li>"festival", "ant", "java", and "javac" must be in your path.
            For example, we used the following command under bash on
            RedHat (modify appropriately):
            <ul>
               <p><code>export
               PATH=/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2/bin:/home/jim/festival/bin:/usr/java/apache-ant-1.5.4/bin:$PATH</code>
            </ul>

            <li>You must set the ESTDIR environment variable to point
            to the speech tools.  For example:
            <ul>
               <p><code>export
               ESTDIR=/home/jim/speech_tools</code>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <p>To convert a voice, run the
        <code>FestVoxToFreeTTS.sh</code> script from a command line
        prompt located in the <code>tools/FestVoxToFreeTTS</code>
        directory:
        <ul>
           <p><code>FestVoxToFreeTTS.sh &lt;voicedir></code>
        </ul>
        <p>where &lt;voicedir> is the directory the FestVox voice 
        resides in.  The contents of <voicedir> will looks something
        like the following:</p>
        <ul>
<pre>
bin/  etc/       FreeTTS/  lpc/     prompt-cep/  recording/  wav/
cep/  f0/        group/    mcep/    prompt-lab/  scratch/    wavn/
dic/  festival/  lab/      pm/      prompt-utt/  sts/        wrd/
emu/  festvox/   lar/      pm_lab/  prompt-wav/  versions/
</pre>
        </ul>

        <p>The script will automatically detect whether it is a
        cluster unit voice or a diphone voice by looking at the 
        &lt;voicedir>/etc/voice.defs file.  If no such file exists, 
        you will need to create it.  An example for a time-telling 
        voice would be something like the following:

        <ul>
<pre>
FV_INST=sun
FV_LANG=time
FV_NAME=dtv
FV_TYPE=ldom
FV_VOICENAME=$FV_INST"_"$FV_LANG"_"$FV_NAME
FV_FULLVOICENAME=$FV_VOICENAME"_"$FV_TYPE
</pre>
        </ul>

        <p>If possible, you can let festival automatically generate
        this for you.  Try
        &lt;<code>festvoxdir>/src/general/guess_voice_defs</code>. 

        <p>FreeTTS will create a new directory
	<code>&lt;voicedir>/FreeTTS/</code>.  In that directory is the
	text which contains all the data for the voice (along with a
	few other intermediate files).  The voice file will have a
	name such as <code>sun_time_dtv.txt</code>.

        <p>The various stages of the conversion process can be called
        directly by passing a second argument to
        <code>FestVoxToFreeTTS.sh</code> such as "sts" or "mcep".
        These should be used carefully.  More information on these
        stages can be found in the Flite documentation.  

        <p>If you do not pass a second argument (recommended) the 
        conversion tool will run the processing stages in the
        following order: "lpc", "sts", "mcep" (if a cluster unit
        voice), "idx", "install", and "compile".  The "install" and 
        "compile" are specific to FreeTTS and are not mentioned in 
        the Flite documentation.  They are the stages that construct 
        the framework for the voice within freetts and compile the
        result.

        <p>When the process gets to the install phase, you will
        encounter a menu.  The install phase only knows how to handle
        US English voices.  If you have any other languages/locales,
        then you should probably exit at this step.  Unfortunately
        adding new languages or locales is beyond the scope of this
        document.

        <p>The menu allows you to define various features about the
        voice:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Name</b>: The name you want to call this voice.
            For example "kevin", "kevin16", "alan", or "dave".

            <li><b>Gender</b>: The gender of the voice.  Select
            help from the menu for a full listing of genders.

            <li><b>Age</b>: The age of the voice.  Select help
            from the menu for a full listing of ages.

            <li><b>Description</b>: A sentence or so that
            describes this voice for others.  

            <li><b>Full Name</b>: - The name that will be used to
            name the voice files and directory.  DON'T USE SPACES.
	    It must be unique
            to this installation of FreeTTS as well as any other
            copy of FreeTTS you expect to use this voice.  For the
            sake of similarity to other voices, it is highly
            recommended to not change this property unless it
            conflicts with an existing voice.  The format for the
            name follows the convention:
            <code>&lt;domain>_&lt;locale>_&lt;name></code>.
            The &lt;name> does not have to match the Name
            property.  The domain generally matches an Internet
            domain or some other globally unique identity.  For
            limited domain voices, you might use the limited domain
            name instead of locale.  Example names include
            <code>cmu_us_kal</code>, <code>cmu_time_awb</code>, 
            and <code>sun_us_dtv</code>.

            <li><b>Domain</b>: The domain if this is a limited 
            (ldom) voice, otherwise it must be set to "general".

            <li><b>Organization</b>: The organization which
            recorded the voice.  For example "cmu" or "sun".
        </ul>

        <p>If there already exists a voice with the same Full Name,
        you are given the option to over-write it, cancel, or change
        the properties.

        <p>When this is done, the voice is put into the FreeTTS
        directory structure
        <code>&lt;FreeTTSdir>/com/sun/speech/freetts/en/us/&lt;voice
        Full Name></code>.  It is recommended to visit this directory
        and confirm that everything looks correct; there should be
        four files similar to the following:
        <pre>
    README                 - Information about the voice
    sun_time_dtv.txt       - The imported voice data in ASCII format
    voice.Manifest         - The Manifest file with which to create the jar file
    DtvVoiceDirectory.java - The VoiceDirectory for this new voice
        </pre>

        <p>If this is a
        limited domain voice for something other than the cmu time
        domain, then you will likely have to make some changes to make
        it look at the correct lexicon.

        <p>As part of the import process, the FestVoxToFreeTTS.sh
        script will create the jar file for the voice.  If you wish
        to create the jar file manually, you can run one of the
        following commands, depending upon the type of voice you 
        have imported (substitute the Full Name of the voice you 
        imported):
        <pre>
    ant -Dclunit_voice=sun_time_dtv -find build.xml
    ant -Ddiphone_voice=sun_us_dtv -find build.xml
        </pre>

        <p>The compiled voice is put in 
        <code>&lt;FreeTTSdir>/lib/&lt;voice Full Name>.jar</code>.

        <p>The voice will automatically be added to the list of
        available voices for FreeTTS.

        <p>You can now test your voice with:
        <ul>
            <p><code>java -jar lib/freetts.jar myvoicename</code>
            (general domain)
            <p><code>java -jar bin/JTime.jar myvoicename</code>
            (time domain)
        </ul> 
        <p>where myvoicename is the name property you assigned
        to your voice in the "install" phase.  If you've forgotten
        the name, you can always retrieve it by executing the jar
        file for your voice:
        <ul>
            <p><code>java -jar lib/&lt;voice Full Name>.jar</code>
        </ul>
