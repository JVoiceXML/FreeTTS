<p>Provides a JSML 0.6 parser as well as a partial and unsupported 
support 
of interfaces in the javax.speech.synthesis package for JSAPI 1.0.  Note this is
not a complete implementation of a speech engine.  It merely provides
skeletal support for speech engines and it meant to be an example for
speech engine developers wishing to support JSAPI 1.0.</p>
