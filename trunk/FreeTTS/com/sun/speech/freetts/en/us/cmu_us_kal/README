There are two versions  of the database:

cmu_us_kal.txt - text version
cmu_us_kal.bin - binary version

The text version is generated by the program in

    flite/v*/testsuite/db_dump_main.c


The binary version is created by the UnitDatabase main line (it reads
in the text version and dumps the binary version). The text version
loads in about 14 seconds. The binary version loads in 1.0 seconds
(mapped files or 1.7 seconds arbitrary input stream).
