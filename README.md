FreeTTS Speech Synthesis System

FreeTTS is a speech synthesis system written entirely in the Java programming language. It is based upon Flite, a small, fast, run-time speech
synthesis engine, which in turn is based upon University of Edinburgh's Festival Speech Synthesis System and Carnegie Mellon University's
FestVox project.
