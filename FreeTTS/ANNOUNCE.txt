FreeTTS is a speech synthesis system written entirely in the Java
programming language. It is based upon Flite, a small, fast, run-time
speech synthesis engine, which in turn is based upon University of
Edinburgh's Festival Speech Synthesis System and Carnegie Mellon
University's FestVox project.  Many thanks to Alan Black and Kevin
Lenzo for their hard work and contributions to speech synthesis
research.

In addition, many thanks to Marc Schroeder and his team in the
Language Technology Lab at DFKI for their additions and improvements
to FreeTTS.

Sincerely,

The FreeTTS Team:  Philip Kwok
(in alph. order)   Paul Lamere
                   Marc Schroeder
                   Willie Walker (overall lead)
