# This test script first runs the FreeTTS with our first utterance file,
# dumps the wave in text form, and compares (diff) it with our standard 
# wave form file for our first utterance (first.wave.txt). This test will
# tell you how many lines differ from the standard wave form file.
#
# (Reminder: our 'first utterance file' is "Hello world.  This is Duke 
# coming to you from inside the java virtual machine. I'm happy to have
# a voice because I've been meaning to tell you how much I care.")
