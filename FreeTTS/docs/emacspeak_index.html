<h1> Welcome to FreeTTS </h1>
This is a stripped down version of FreeTTS that has all JSAPI
dependencies removed.  When reading the 
<a href="docs/index.html">full documentation</a>, 
please keep this in mind.

Furthermore, this is a <b>source only</b> release, which means you
need to build FreeTTS before doing anything.  You can build FreeTTS
by following the <a href="docs/index.html#how_build">build instructions.</a>

<h2> How do I run the FreeTTS Emacspeak server? </h2>
This version of FreeTTS is written primarily for releasing the
non-JSAPI version of the emacspeak server.  

See these <a href="demo/freetts/Emacspeak/README.html">instructions</a> 
on building and running the non-JSAPI version of the Emacspeak server.

<h2> What is FreeTTS? </h2>
<p>FreeTTS is a speech synthesis system written entirely in the Java<sup><font size="-1">TM</font></sup> programming language. It is based upon <a href="http://www.cmuflite.org">Flite 1.2</a>: a small run-time speech synthesis engine developed at Carnegie Mellon University. Flite is derived from the <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/">Festival</a> Speech Synthesis System from 
the University of Edinburgh and the <a href="http://festvox.org/">FestVox</a> project from Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
