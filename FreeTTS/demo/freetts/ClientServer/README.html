    <pre>

To run this ClientServer demo, you need to run two things: the Server 
and the Client.


To run the Server, on the machine you want to run the server, type:

gmake runserver

If you want to use MBROLA voices, please refer to the 
<a href="../../../docs/MbrolaSetup.txt">MBROLA Setup Page</a> for MBROLA installation instructions.
Remember that you must set the <code>MBROLA_DIR</code> environment 
variable to your MBROLA directory. To use MBROLA voices, type one of:

gmake runMbrola1Server
gmake runMbrola2Server
gmake runMbrola3Server


You should see the following output:
<b>
Waiting on ServerSocket[addr=0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0,port=0,localport=5555]
</b>

To see how quickly the server handles TTS request, you can set the "metrics"
system property to true in the Makefile. This will cause the "time to
first byte sent" to client to be printed out for each TTS request.


To run the Java(TM) Client

1. You need to tell it where the Server is by modifying the Makefile.
   In the "runjclient" section, replace "localhost" with the name of
   the host the server is running.

2. Type: gmake runjclient


To run the C Client:

1. You need to tell it where the Server is by modifying the Makefile.
   In the "runcclient" section, replace "localhost" with the name of
   the host the server is running.

2. Type: gmake runcclient

After running either of the clients, the following prompt should appear:

<b>
Receiving : 32886 samples
Say       : 
</b>

and you should hear a voice saying "type in what you want me to say".
At this point, you should hear what you type in (and press Enter).

<b>
Waiting on ServerSocket[addr=0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0,port=0,localport=5555]
... new socket connection
</b>


For each client, there are respective "metrics" switches that you can
turn on in the Makefile to show the response times of the TTS server.
