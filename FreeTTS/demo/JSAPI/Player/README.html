    <p>The Player demonstrates the use of JSAPI to build
    applications. It is capable of performing text-to-speech on ASCII
    text, ASCII text files, JSML text, and JSML files. Here is a
    snapshot of the Player:

        <h3>Building</h3>
        <p>To build this demo, merely type the following in a shell:
        <ul>
            <code>ant -find demo.xml</code>
        </ul>
        <p>Doing so will create
        <code>bin/Player.jar</code>, which you can run
        using <code>java -jar</code> (see "Running" below).


        <h3>Running</h3>
        <p>To run this demo, type the following command from a command
        window:</p>
        <ul>
            <p><code>java -jar bin/Player.jar</code></p>
        </ul>

        <p>The player will find all available voices, including voices
        in all domains (e.g., general and time), and allow you to
        select them for synthesizing text. If you want the Player to
        use MBROLA voices, you must <a
        href="../../../mbrola/README.html">setup
        and install MBROLA</a> before using MBROLA voices.</p>

        <h3>Instructions for Use</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Plain Text</b>: Simply enter text at the
	    <b>"Enter text"</b> text area, then press the button
	    <b>"Speak Text"</b>. The text you entered will be played,
	    and inserted to the Play List.
	
            <li><p><b>Text File</b>: Select the <b>File</b> menu,
            <b>Speak</b>, <b>Text File...</b>. A file choosing dialog
            will appear. Select a text file, which will be added to
            the Play List and played. Do not use this method if you
            want to play a JSML file. Instead, see the bullet <i>JSML
            file</i>.

            <li><p><b>JSML Text</b>: Simply enter JSML text at the
            <b>"Enter text"</b> text area, then press the button
            <b>"Speak JSML"</b>. The text you entered will be played,
            and inserted to the Play List.

            <li><p><b>JSML File</b>: Select the <b>File</b> menu,
            <b>Speak</b>, <b>JSML File...</b>. A file choosing dialog
            will appear. Select a JSML file, which will be added to
            the Play List and played. There are some JSML files in
            this directory which you can try out. Do not use this
            method if you want to play a text file. Instead, see the
            bullet <i>Text file</i>.

            <li><p><b>URL</b>: It is assumed that the URL is a JSML
            URL. Select the <b>File</b> menu, <b>Speak</b>,
            <b>URL...</b>. A dialog will appear asking you to enter a
            URL. After entering the URL, press <b>OK</b>. The new URL
            will be added to your Play List, and will start to play.    
        </ul>

        <p><b>NOTE:</b> To play any item(s) on the Play List again,
        simply select it on the Play List and press <b>Play</b>.  To
        clear the text in the text area, press <b>Clear</b>.

        <h3>Other Features</h3> <p>In addition to text-to-speech, the
        Player has the following functionality:
        <ol>
            <li>Pause and resume the playing of text (<b>Pause</b> button).
            <li>Cancel the current utterance (<b>Cancel</b> button).
            <li>Change the volume (<b>Volume</b> slider), speaking
            rate in words per minute (<b>Words/min</b> slider), the
            pitch (<b>Pitch/Hz</b> slider), and the range
            (<b>Range</b> slider). The <i>pitch</i> is the base pitch
            of the voice, where <i>range</i> is amount of pitch
            variation allowed. Note that these changes will take
            effect only on the next utterance.
            <li>Change to another synthesizer (<b>Synthesizer</b>
            combo box) and voice (<b>Voice</b> combo box).
            <li>Monitor the progress of the text-to-speech process
            (select menu <b>Monitor</b>, <b>Show</b>).
	    <li>Change the default look & feel (select <b>Style</b>
	    menu, <b>Look & Feel</b>, and then select the desired look
	    & feel).
        </ol>

        <h3>Engine Monitor</h3> 

        <p>The Player also includes a Synthesizer Engine Monitor,
        which allows you to observe the changes in the state of the
        synthesizer during different stages, e.g., when initializing,
        performing TTS, etc.. Simply select the <b>Monitor</b> menu,
        <b>Show</b>) to see it working. To hide it, select the
        <b>Monitor</b> menu, <b>Hide</b>. Here's a snapshot of the
        Player with the Monitor:
