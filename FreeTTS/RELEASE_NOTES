--------------------------

March, 9, 2009 Release 1.2.2:
    - Introduced an AliasDiphone class as a subclass of Diphone, which
      has a name and an original diphone; most API calls are just
      forwarded to the original diphone. (Marc Schroeder)
    - In text db files, introduced a new type of line, "ALIAS new
      old", where "old" is the name of an existing diphone (must have
      been defined higher-up in the text db file using the traditional
      "DIPHONE...." mechanism), and "new" is the new name under which
      the diphone is to be known additionally.
      DiphoneUnitDatabase.parseAndAdd () has been adapted accordingly.
      (Marc Schroeder)
    - In binary db files, introduced a new magic code identifying an
      alias diphone entry. Diphone.loadBinary() has been adapted
      accordingly. (Marc Schroeder)
    - Fixed "Class-Path" issue in manifest created by FestVoxToFreeTTS.
      (Willie Walker)
    - Fixed internal class loader problems (Dirk Schnelle-Walka)
    - using java logging library instead of system.out.println
    - separation into a core jar and a jsapi1.0 dependent jar
      (Dirk Schnelle-Walka)
    - Bugfixes in JavaClipAudioPlayer ((Dirk Schnelle-Walka):
      Catching runtime exceptions if the line is not available
      writing directly to the output line instead of buffering the data
    - some code cleanup (Dirk Schnelle-Walka)
    
March 10, 2005 Release 1.2.1
    - Add support for metrics important to screen readers
    - Add drain delay to clip audio player - the lack of
      it was causing the end of speech to be cut on JDS/Linux

February 06, 2005 Release 1.2 (final)
    - Hang with JDK1.5 (bug 1019337)
    - Added support to build w/o requiring JSAPI
    - Only build tests on demand (more freedom from JUnit)
    - Added build targets to create standalone emacspeak app
    - Added ability for emacspeak demo to strip DECTalk commands from text
    - Added speaking rate change support to emacspeak demo
    - Allowed emacspeak text to omit '{' and '}' if text has no spaces
    - Changed state name expansion logic (bug 1101229)
    - Added pronunciations for British Sterling and "not" sign (bug 1100888)
    - Modified missing speech.properties message (rfe 1041437 and bug 1041296)
    - Added pronunciations for Linux terms (bug 1006630)
    - Added JUnit to prerequisites list (bug 975557)
    - Fixed -dump{Multi}Audio problem in freetts app (bug 986503).

    - In the Voice class, removed the call to AudioPlayer.drain() 
      if the audio is cancelled, since it will block until the next audio
      is available.
    - Fixed problem in FreeTTSSynthesizer where in some cases waiting 
      threads are not notified when a queue item is cancelled.
    - Made the JavaStreamingAudioPlayer.cancel() method unsynchronized
      so that audio output can be stopped immediately.
    - Added rudimentary internationalization to Festvox import.
      This imports international (non-US-English) cluster unit voices,
      but obviously still lacks a lexicon and other NLP components for
      new languages.

    - Added experimental CMUArcticVoice that may (or may not) work
      with the CMU ARCTIC databases.

Jun 5, 2003 Release 1.2beta
    - Updated FreeTTS version message

Jun 4, 2003 Release 1.2beta
    - Imported changes from Flite 1.2:
        - Regenerated cmulex_addenda, cart_dump
        - Reads year "1200" as "twelve hundred" rather than "twelve oh
          zero"
        - TimeUtils reads 00:01 as "just after midnight" rather than
          "just after midnight, in the morning".
        - Added "daughter1" to be an alias for "daughter"
        - Minor bug fixes in TokenToWords and ClusterUnitSelector
    - Regenerated test data to compare FreeTTS against Flite 1.2
    - Wrote script gen_flite_data.sh to help automate updates to test
      data.

May 13, 2003 Release 1.1.2
    - Fixed bug in TokenToWords that causes abbreviations like "OK"
      and "HI" to be spoken as a US state rather than just "ok" and "hi".

    - Fixed race condition in JavaStreamingAudioPlayer that would
      cause output to not be totally cancelled.

    - Refactored all System.getProperty calls to call a wrapper
      utility called Utilities.getPropery. This method catches a
      SecurityException and deals with it properly, so that it can be
      called from an applet.

    - Fixed problem in the JSAPI implementation where the audio player
      was not being closed when the synthesizer was deallocated. This
      would cause problems for certain types of AudioPlayers such as
      SingleFileAudioPlayer that require a 'close' before they flush
      their accumulated wave data.

September 6, 2002 Release 1.1.1
    - Fixed index.html so that it looks for the RELEASE_NOTES in 
      the proper spot.
    - Added RELEASE_NOTES to the deploy_doc Make target.
    - Fixed all run.bat files to run properly under Win32 systems.
    - Fixed race condition in com.sun.speech.engine.EngineMonitor that
      would cause a NullPointerException in the Player demo on
      occasion.
    - Added emacspeak deploy options
    - Added non-JSAPI version of Emacspeak speech server
    - Fixed non-JSAPI Emacspeak demo crashing problem by using the
      JavaStreamingAudioPlayer (instead of ClipPlayer) as the default.
    - Added RawFileAudioPlayer to write raw audio bytes to a binary file.
    - Changed all  JDK_DIR references to JAVA_HOME
    - Fixed problem in parsing certain dates (MonthRange)
    - Fixed problem with some number parsing 
    - Removed hardcoded array size of LPCResult.residualToFloatMap
    - Fixed problem where output thread was not being shut down when a
      voice was closed.
    - Added TokenGame test which exercises some tricky tokenizing
    - Screen shots of Player in demo/JSAPI/Player/readme.html now of
      current version.

      tests

    - Refactored identical demo code in the JSAPI and freetts branches
      so that they share the same code (put in demo/util directory).

      connection.
    - Added JSAPI/Web Start clock demo to show how to use FreeTTS/JSAPI
      with Java Web Start.
    - Added support for MBROLA Voices, as well as JSAPI support for
      MBROLA Voices. Specifically, the latter refers to check for
      the MBROLA binaries and databse for an MBROLA voice. If they
      are found, such a voice is consider 'valid'.
    - Fixed the following bug: A word followed by a breaking
      punctuation (:?!), followed by space and a single word,
      e.g., "RE: Frank", causes the word following the breaking
      punctuation (i.e., "Frank") not to be synthesized.
    - Fixed the following bug: "From:" or "From" causes the system to
      hang.
    - Added MBROLA support to all appropriate demos.

    - Improved rules for generating binary forms of the databases
    - Specifies 'Locale.US' (instead of null) when constructing a 
      SynthesizerModeDesc in the demo code
    - Output of regression tests are more consistent
