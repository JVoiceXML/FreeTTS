This directory contains the necessary files for converting FestVox voices
for FreeTTS.


--------- Creating a Voice ---------

The voices must first be created by FestVox.  Please refer to the FestVox
documentation for full information.  (http://festvox.org,
http://festvox.org/bsv/) Section IV.19 provides a good tutorial on making a US
Diphone voice, and Section II.5.6 provides a good tutorial on recording a
cluster unit voice for the limited domain of telling the time.  Section II.5
provides a good general explaination of creating a limited domain voice in
general.  If you want to experiment with voice creation and conversion,
creating a time telling voice is a good place to begin.

In our experience, FestVox and Festival work better under Linux x86 platforms.


--------- Importing a FestVox Voice into FreeTTS ---------

FreeTTS follow many of the same steps that Flite
(http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite) does for importing voices.  For a more
detailed description of the process, please read Section 8 of the Flite
documentation (http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/doc/index.html).

To import a voice into FreeTTS, you first need to do the following things:
1. Compile Festival (http://festvox.org/) as well as the speech tools that
    come with Festival.  Refer to the Festival documentation for details
    of setting this up on your system.
2. You must have Java and a Java Compiler installed on your system.
    See http://java.sun.com if you do not already have this.
3. "festival", "java", and "javac" must be in your path.  For example, I used
    the following command under bash (modify appropriately):
    "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2/bin:\
     /home/dv144877/festival/bin/"
4. You must set the ESTDIR environment variable to point to the speech tools.
    e.g. "export ESTDIR=/home/dv144877/speech_tools"

To convert a voice, run:
FestVoxToFreeTTS.sh <voicedir>
where <voicedir> is the directory the FestVox voice resides in.  FreeTTS will
create a new directory <voicdir>/FreeTTS/   In that directory is the text
which contains all the data for the voice (along with a few other unnecessary
files).  The voice file will have a name like sun_time_dtv.txt

The various stages of the conversion process can be called directly by passing
a second argument to FestVoxToFreeTTS.sh such as "sts" or "mcep".  These should
be used carefully.  More information on these stages can be found in the
Flite documentation.

See "FestVoxToFreeTTS.sh --help" for more information.
